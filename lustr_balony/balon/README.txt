# Summary

Here is my new Lampshade "Balloon".  
It hopefully looks like an hot air balloon and its maybe for younger people ;)  
This design has three parts and it needs a additional string that is approx. 30cm long.  
The second picture shows how to put this together.  
I hope you like it and share pictures if you printed this.  

I printed this with Slic3r's vase mode or with cura - both works really well.
  
PLA - 0.2mm layer height // vase mode.

edit:

Please increase the flow rate at vase mode because of that really big overhang on the top of the balloon! 180% works really well!


01.11.2016 : edit: uploaded a finer version of the balloon.

13.04.2019 : edit: uploaded a gcode for a stock creality ender 3 because of some people who had problems to print it. :)
